Usage: pkglink {OPTIONS} [dir] [dirN]

Description:

     pkglink - Node.js package hard linker

     pkglink recursively searches directories for Node.js packages
     installed in node_modules directories. It uses the package name
     and version to match up possible packages to share. Once it finds
     similar packages, pkglink walks through the package directory tree
     checking for files that can be linked. If each file's modified
     datetime and size match, it will create a hard link for that file
     to save disk space.

     It keeps track of modules linked in ~/.pkglink_refs to quickly
     locate similar modules on future runs. The refs are always
     double checked before being considered for linking. This makes
     it convenient to perform future pkglink runs on new directories
     without having to reprocess the old.

Standard Options:

 -c, --config CONFIG_PATH

  This option overrides the config file path, default ~/.pkglink

 -d, --dryrun

  Instead of performing the linking, just display the modules that
  would be linked and the amount of disk space that would be saved.

 -g, --gen-ln-cmds

  Instead of performing the linking, just generate link commands
  that the system would perform and output

 -h, --help

  Show this message

 -p, --prune

  Prune the refs file by checking all of the refs clearing out any
  that have changed

 -r, --refs-file REFS_FILE_PATH

  Specify where to load and store the link refs file which is used to
  quickly locate previously linked modules. Default ~/pkglink_refs.json

 -t, --tree-depth N

  Maximum depth to search the directories specified for node modules
  Default depth: 0 (unlimited)
